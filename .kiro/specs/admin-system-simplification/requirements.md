# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves simplifying the admin system by removing unnecessary pages (profile and dashboard), consolidating the main admin page to directly show the links management interface, and updating the layout to use a full-width design without sidebars.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a simplified admin interface that directly shows the links management page, so that I can quickly access the main functionality without navigating through unnecessary pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user navigates to `/admin` THEN the system SHALL display the links management interface directly
2. WHEN an admin user accesses the admin system THEN the system SHALL NOT show profile or dashboard pages
3. WHEN the admin page loads THEN the system SHALL use the main content from `src/app/admin/links/page.tsx`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the admin interface to use the full width of the screen, so that I can see more content and have a better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin page is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a 12-column grid layout without sidebars
2. WHEN the admin interface renders THEN the system SHALL occupy the full available width
3. WHEN the layout is applied THEN the system SHALL NOT display any sidebar navigation elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused admin pages, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain `src/app/admin/profile` directory
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain `src/app/admin/dashboard` directory
3. WHEN unused files are removed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality for the links management feature
