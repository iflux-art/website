# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to refactor the existing codebase structure to improve code organization by clearly separating shared/common code from feature-specific code. The refactoring will reorganize types, utilities, hooks, and components across `src/app`, `src/components`, and `src/features` directories to create a more maintainable and scalable architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared code to be properly organized in common directories, so that I can easily find and reuse common functionality across different features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing code THEN the system SHALL identify types, utilities, hooks, and components that are used by multiple features
2. WHEN extracting shared code THEN the system SHALL move common types to `src/types` directory with proper categorization
3. WHEN extracting shared code THEN the system SHALL move common utility functions to `src/lib` directory with proper categorization
4. WHEN extracting shared code THEN the system SHALL move common hooks to `src/hooks` directory with proper categorization
5. WHEN extracting shared code THEN the system SHALL move common components to `src/components` directory with proper categorization
6. WHEN moving shared code THEN the system SHALL create or update index files for unified exports
7. WHEN moving shared code THEN the system SHALL update all import paths throughout the codebase to reference the new locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want feature-specific code to be organized within feature directories, so that I can maintain clear boundaries between different business domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing code THEN the system SHALL identify types, utilities, hooks, and components that are specific to individual features
2. WHEN organizing feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL create `types`, `lib`, `hooks`, and `components` subdirectories within each feature directory as needed
3. WHEN moving feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL place feature-specific types in `src/features/{feature}/types` directories
4. WHEN moving feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL place feature-specific utilities in `src/features/{feature}/lib` directories
5. WHEN moving feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL place feature-specific hooks in `src/features/{feature}/hooks` directories
6. WHEN moving feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL place feature-specific components in `src/features/{feature}/components` directories
7. WHEN organizing feature code THEN the system SHALL create or update index files within each feature for unified exports
8. WHEN moving feature-specific code THEN the system SHALL update all import paths to reference the new feature-specific locations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import paths to be automatically updated during the refactoring, so that the application continues to function correctly after the reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving any file THEN the system SHALL identify all files that import from the moved file
2. WHEN updating import paths THEN the system SHALL replace old import paths with new paths in all affected files
3. WHEN updating import paths THEN the system SHALL maintain relative path accuracy based on the new file locations
4. WHEN updating import paths THEN the system SHALL preserve import aliases and named imports correctly
5. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken import references remain
6. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL verify that all TypeScript compilation errors related to imports are resolved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent export patterns across all directories, so that I can easily import functionality using predictable patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating index files THEN the system SHALL export all relevant items from the directory
2. WHEN creating index files THEN the system SHALL use consistent export patterns (named exports preferred)
3. WHEN organizing shared directories THEN the system SHALL create a main index file at `src/types/index.ts`, `src/lib/index.ts`, `src/hooks/index.ts`, and `src/components/index.ts`
4. WHEN organizing feature directories THEN the system SHALL create index files for each feature's subdirectories as needed
5. WHEN creating exports THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
6. WHEN creating exports THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices for module exports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain the same functionality, so that no existing features are broken during the reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing functionality remains intact
2. WHEN moving code THEN the system SHALL preserve all function signatures and component interfaces
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing export/import relationships
4. WHEN reorganizing code THEN the system SHALL not modify the internal logic of functions, hooks, or components
5. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL ensure the application builds successfully
6. WHEN completing the refactoring THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing tests continue to pass
